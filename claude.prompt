so I want to create a process orchestration application in C (for speed). The goal is to have a control application and an agent.
The agent will run in a container and talk to the controller in some way (you define it).
The controller will ask the agent to start some process (name, argument...).
The agent will execute and return to the controller either an error or a pid of the process.
From there the controller will ack receiving the pid (or error) and if starting the process was successful (received a pid) it will start monitoring that process.
The controller should thus be able to: start process, list processes, stop process, apply constraints (cgroups limitations) to a running process
